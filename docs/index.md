# Welcome to Vulkan Bits
- Are you learning to use the shiny new perfomant Vulkan API?
- Are you having difficulty figuring out how to do things properly?
- Do you have exactly 0 connections whatsoever with any NVDIA or AMD engineers who know about obscure bugs and/or quirks you'd never possibly find out about by yourself until it's too late?
- You can't possibly read or understand completely the entirety of the [Vulkan Specification](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html) documentation trying to find out why your triangles don't triangle?

Then you might found this guide useful!

Vulkan bits is a collection of tips and tricks quirks one should be aware of while using the Vulkan API, compiled by me and possibly other people as we all figure this stuff out.

If you know about something somebody might find useful, don't be afraid to open [a pull request](https://github.com/DeltaW0x/vulkan-bits) to help others in the fantastic journey that is graphics programming!

Vulkan bits is divided in sections, one for each category of the API, such as swapchain, descriptor set management, so on and so forth.

Good luck!
